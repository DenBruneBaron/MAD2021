\section{Problem 3}
\subsection{(a)} 
Computing the "naive" mean using the training set.

$$mean = 22.016601$$

this value is used to obtain the estimates for a new house
\subsection{(b)}
calculating the Root Mean Sqare Error value.

$$RMSE = 9.672478 $$
\subsection{(c)}
For the rest of the code/results see the extended \textbf{housing\_1.py}

The figure shows the 2d scatter plot for ("True house prices" vs. "Estimates") for all instances in the test set
