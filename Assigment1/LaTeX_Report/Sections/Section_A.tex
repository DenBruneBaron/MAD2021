\section{Problem 1}
the exercise is to compute the partial derivations of the following
three problems each containing a different function.
\subsection{(a)}
Considering the function, it is fairly straight forward to compute the derivative with respect
to x and y. Both derivations will be done using the power rule: $x^n = nx^{n-1}$
$$f(x,y) = x^4y^3+x^5-e^y$$
\textbf{Answer:}
\\
calculating $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$
$$f'_{x} = 4x^3y^3+5x^4$$
calculating $\frac{\partial}{\partial y}$
$$f'_{y} = x^43y^2-e^y$$
It is worth mentioning, that the exponent ($e^y$) will derive to itself even though
the power function states otherwise.
\subsection{(b)}
This function is bit harder to compute.
$$f(x,y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^3+xy+y^2}}$$
I will start by deriving the innter function with respect to x and y since these derivations
are going to be used later on in the calculations.
\\
\\
calculating $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$
$$f'_{x} = 3x^2+y$$
calculating $\frac{\partial}{\partial y}$
$$f'_{y} = x+2y$$
\textbf{Answer:}\\
I will rewrite the function using simple fraction rules in order to make the function
a bit easier to work with.
$$f(x,y) = (x^3+xy+y^2)^{-\frac{1}{2}}$$
applying the power rule
$$f(x,y) = -\frac{1}{2}(x^3+xy+y^2)^{-\frac{3}{2}}$$
applying the chain rule
$$f(x,y) = -\frac{1}{2}(x^3+xy+y^2)^{-\frac{3}{2}} \cdot (3x^2+y)$$
\subsection{(c)}
$$f(x,y) = \frac{x^3+y^2}{x+y}$$
