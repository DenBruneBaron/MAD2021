\section{Problem 3}
\subsection{(a)}
The a PDF is the derivative of a CDF.
\\
The function $e^{- \beta x^{\alpha}}$ is a composition of f(g(x)). 
Thus the after applying the chainrule and deriving where $g(x) = - \beta x^{\alpha} $ :
$$\frac{d}{dx} f(g(x)) = \frac{d}{dx} (- \beta x^{\alpha} \cdot e^{{g(x)}}) = - \beta \alpha x^{\alpha-1} \cdot e^{- \beta x^{\alpha}} $$
\\
Thus the PDF is:
\[f(x) \begin{cases}
    - \beta \alpha x^{\alpha-1} \cdot e^{- \beta x^{\alpha}} & \quad \text{if} \quad x > 0 \\
    0 & \quad \text{otherwise} \\
 \end{cases}
\]

\subsection{(b)}
In this question there are two subquestions.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the probability that the chip works longer than four years?
    \item What is the probability that the chip stops working in the time interval [5;
    10] years?
\end{enumerate}
I'm given two values for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ stubstituting these values into the original
function I have:
$$ f(x) = 1 - e^{-\frac{1}{4}x^2} = 1 - e^{-\frac{x^2}{4}} $$
\\
To answer the first question I can simply calculate f(5). Since I'm asked to answer the probability
for the chip to live \emph{more} than four years
