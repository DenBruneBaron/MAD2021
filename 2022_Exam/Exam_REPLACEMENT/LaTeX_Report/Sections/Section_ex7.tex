\section{Problem 7 - K-means Clustering \& Principal Component Analysis}

% a) Provide a code snippet in the report showing how you perform the normalization
\subsection {a)}
I've decided to make my own function to normalize my data. It normalizes the input
value x by subtracting the mean and dividion by the standard deviation.
\begin{minted}[linenos, bgcolor = bg, breaklines]{python}
    def normalizeData(x):
    '''
    Normalizes the input using mean and the standard deviation.
    Normalization is done on all the columns in the 2d numpy-array 'x'

    Returns the normalized 'x'
    '''
    return (x - np.mean(x, axis=0)) / np.std(x, axis=0)
\end{minted}

\subsection {b)}
% b) provide a code snippet in the report showing your K-means implementation

% c) include the number of samples in each cluster in the report

% d) provide a code snippet and explanation of what you did in the report

% e) include a code snippet, the plot and your reflections on the results in the report.
