\section{Problem 4}
\subsection{(a)}
In this exercise I'm asked to choose the null hypothesis.
\\
My Null hypothesis is:, $ H_0 : \mu_0 = 0 $
My alternative hypothesis is, $H_A : \mu \neq \mu_0$
\\
Which menas, that I assume that there is no difference in flowering time, since the value for $X_3 - Y_3 = -0.5$ showing that
the scientists claim does not hold for all of the samples. With the specified
alternative hypothesis, I would have to perform af two-sided t-test
\\
$ \mu_0 = 0 $ since the assumption is, that there is no difference between the two types of flowers

\subsection{(b)}
Performing the corrosponding t-test (Assuming that I have to perform the corrosponding thest to my claim in (a)).
Following the "six steps" from the lecture. I will be starting from step 3 since both step one and two are defined in question (a).
The dataset is $ X_i - Y_i $, which gives me
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c|c|c| } 
     \hline
      1 & 0.5 & -0.5 & 1.5 & 0.5\\ 
     \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}


\noindent Calculating the observed mean = $ \frac{1 + 0.5 - 0.5 + 1.5 + 0.5}{5} = 0.6 $
\\
Calculating the standard deviation for my sample \\
$ S = \sqrt{Var(Z)}$ \\
\\
$ Var(Z) = \sum_{i=1}^{5} \frac{(x_i - \overline{x})^2}{n-1} $ \\
\\
$ Var(Z) = \frac{(1 - 0.6)^2 + (0.5 - 0.6)^2 + (-0.5 - 0.6)^2 + (1.5 - 0.6)^2 + (0.5 - 0.6)^2}{4} = \frac{2.2}{4} = 0.55 $  
\\
\\
$ S = \sqrt{0.55} = 0.7416$
\\
\\
$t = \frac{\overline{x} - \mu_0}{S \sqrt{n}} = \frac{0.6 - 0}{0.7416 \sqrt{5}} = \frac{0.6}{0.3317} \approx 1.81 $
\\
\\
I've calculated $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ using the following small code.

\begin{minted}[linenos, bgcolor = bg]{python}
    import scipy.stats

    gamma = 0.95
    fac1 = scipy.stats.norm.ppf((1-gamma)/2, 0, 1)  
    fac2 = scipy.stats.norm.ppf((1-gamma)/2 + gamma, 0, 1)

    print(fac1)
    print(fac2)
\end{minted}
