\section{Problem 4}
\subsection{(a)}
In this exercise I'm asked to choose the null hypothesis.
\\
The dataset is $ X_i - Y_i $, which gives me
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c|c|c| } 
     \hline
      1 & 0.5 & -0.5 & 1.5 & 0.5\\ 
     \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

Calculating the observed mean = $ \frac{1 + 0.5 - 0.5 + 1.5 + 0.5}{5} = 0.6 $
\\
$ \mu_0 = 0 $ since the assumption is, that there is no difference between the two types of flowers
\\
Thus my null hypothesis is: $ H_0 : \mu_0 = 0 $
